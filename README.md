# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Operation

This repository showcases a common error in Dart asynchronous programming and demonstrates a proper solution.

The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API.  The error handling is incomplete; only the error is printed, without proper handling or logging.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a better way to handle potential exceptions, allowing for more robust error management in your applications.

## Problem

The original code lacks comprehensive error handling in the asynchronous operation. Simply printing the error is insufficient for production applications.  It lacks mechanisms to: 

* Log the error for debugging purposes.
* Provide informative error messages to the user.
* Implement retry mechanisms.
* Gracefully handle the failure without crashing the application.

## Solution

The improved code in `bugSolution.dart` addresses these issues by providing a more complete `catch` block. The solution includes:
